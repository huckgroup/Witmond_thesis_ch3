## Description

This is the data analysis folder for the thesis chapter titled: *Adaptation of immunodetection by sequencing (ID-seq) to study B-cell receptor signaling*.



## Abstract

Cells process extracellular signals from their environment through vast intracellular signaling networks. Measuring the protein phosphorylation events involved in cell signaling provides information on the intracellular dynamics of information processing at the protein level. Here, we have adapted and implemented immunodetection by sequencing (ID-seq) for B-cell signaling research, to measure 111 unique (phospho-)protein targets simultaneously. We have optimised the blocking, staining, PCR and clean-up steps to create an experimental protocol that produces robust datasets. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate how ID-seq enables the investigation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in two B-cell lymphomas. We reveal network-wide phosphorylation of B-cell signaling proteins upon activation in both a Burkittâ€™s lymphoma and a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell model. B-cell receptor stimulation led to phosphorylation events in the core B-cell signaling hub, while hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) inhibition of phosphatases resulted in strong changes in global phosphorylation levels. These findings confirm how ID-seq can shed light on the effect of different perturbations on B-cell signaling, which is promising for both understanding malignancies and furthering drug development.
